## Project Title: Milestone on Data Analysis with THE INCUBATOR HUB
### Project Overview
---
**Data set** is a collection of data points and Data point is a single attribute in a data set. when data is generted, it comes in different structure and it has to be stored for future accessibility. Before Data can be analsysed it all starts with data generation, data storage, data transformation and then analysis which is folowed by data presentation. 
Analysis should strike what is working, what is not working and what we should focus on. **The Incubator Hub** gave me the opportunity to be part of  Ladies in tech bootcamp in Data Analysis. The cousre has been grouped into modules starting from *MSEXCEL, SQL and POWER BI*. The training has been on youtube and various tutors has been helping out. 

### Tools used
  1. MSExcel (Data cleaning, analysis and visualisation)
  2. SQL(Structured Query Language)
  3. Power BI (for visualisation)
  4. GitHub (for portfolio building)


### SQL Module
Mushin Hamed. has took us the MSExcel course which lasted for 3weeks. we worked on Data entry fundamentals, Formatting in Excel and Data validation. we did:
1. Autofit
2. cell validation

5. Excel Functions

    #### Exploratory Data Analysis
    EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer questions about the data such as:
     i. What is the overall sales trend?
     ii. Which product are top sellers?
     iii. What are the products on peak sales?

   ### Data Analysis
   ```SQL
   select * from table1

   ```
